### Exercise: Python Variables
1. Create a variable called break and assign it a value 5. See what happens and find out the reason behind the behavior that you see.
3. Create two variables. One to store your birth year and another one to store current year. Now calculate your age using these two variables
4. Store your first, middle and last name in three different variables and then print your full name using these variables
5. Answer which of these are invalid variable names: 
   _nation
   1record
   record1
   record_one
   record-one
   record^one
   continue
   
   # invalid names are
   record-one
   record^one
   continue
   
   [Solution](https://github.com/codebasics/py/blob/master/Basics/Exercise/2_variables/2_variables_exercise.ipynb)
   #creating an variable called breack and assigning an value 5
   Breack=5
   #finding an age between the current year and birth year
   current_year=2023
   Birth_year=2001
   # using subtracting method
   current_year-Birth_year
   # or
   No_of_years=Birth_year-current_year
   print(No_of_years)
   #printing my full name
   x='manoj'
   y='kumar'
   z='chiluka'
   print(x+y+z)
